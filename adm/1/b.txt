# ADM1 Theoretic Principles

These principles are the learning foundation of the administration work for an HPC Cluster.
Many primitives and fundamentals are described and recalled such as electricity and signals, networking and infrastructure.
Additionally many subjects like security, resource management, monitoring, and software stacks are described.

## Requirements

* Using knowledge (USE2)

## Learning outcomes

* Understand the hardware components of a computer and also investigate virtualisation techniques
* Describe the components required for networking including cables, protocols, and fabrics
* Review the boot process and investigate BIOS options, netboot procedures as well as bootloaders
* Summarize monitoring options including CLI monitoring, files under /proc, and different architectures
* Generalize cluster management options including SSH for administrator access, user management, and system provisioning
* Understand quota for files and compute, user limits and job managers
* Understand the Unix Permission model, how to verify authenticity, 2FA procedures and advanced fencing
* Practice how to model power consumption and understand fundamental concepts such as cables and batteries
