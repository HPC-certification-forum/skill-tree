# ADM3.4.1 Stateful Image

An HPC cluster consists of several central components such as storage, workload manager, subnet manager, etc., which sometimes run on dedicated servers. These servers must be deployed from  the central management system. Usually these servers have local hard disks, so a stateful installation of these servers is necessary.                                                         

Students should learn how to create stateful node images for HPC clusters. They should be able to use provisioning software to create and configure such images. They should know how to customize stateful node images.
