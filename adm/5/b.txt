# ADM5.1 Workflow Management Systems - Snakemake

Snakemake offer to setup a system-wide configuration file, selecting the 
default excecutor (Snakemake lingo for the execution of job, e.g. for 
cloud systems or HPC batch sytems) or defining remote file paths (e.g. to 
stage-in and out data "automagically").

## Requirements:

* [[skill-tree:use:6:3:b]]

## Learning Objectivs

- Knowing about Snakemake's ability to configure it's behaviour cluster-wide.
- Learning how to setup and install a cluster-wide yaml-based configuration file (which will not interfere with Nextflow or other systems) to tune the behaviour for Snakemake (i.e. auto-submit to SLURM, LSF, etc., auto-stage-in/-out data, adjust for putative file system latency).
