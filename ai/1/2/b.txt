# AI1.2 AI Workflow Management

This skill covers tools, strategies, and principles for designing and managing AI workflows on HPC systems. It addresses orchestration, scheduling, automation, and reproducibility of AI pipelines across distributed infrastructure.

## Requirements

* External: Familiarity with AI training/inference steps and command-line environments
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Define the components of a typical AI workflow (data preprocessing, training, evaluation, deployment).
* Describe the role of workflow engines (e.g., Snakemake, Nextflow, Airflow) in managing AI pipelines.
* Demonstrate how to schedule and monitor multi-stage AI tasks on HPC resources.
* Apply versioning and reproducibility best practices in AI workflow design.
* Understand error handling, checkpointing, and dependency resolution in distributed AI pipelines.
