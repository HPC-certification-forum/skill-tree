# AI1.3 Agents

This skill introduces the concept of software agents in AI systems, including autonomous and semi-autonomous agents used for decision-making, task execution, or coordination. It focuses on their design, deployment, and integration in HPC-based AI workflows.

## Requirements

* External: Basic knowledge of reinforcement learning or AI model behavior
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Define what constitutes an AI agent in the context of HPC workloads.
* Differentiate between reactive, deliberative, and hybrid agent architectures.
* Explain use cases for agents in model orchestration, data interaction, and simulation-based learning.
* Describe the lifecycle of an agent from initialization to termination in an HPC pipeline.
* Evaluate agent behavior in terms of autonomy, adaptability, and communication.
