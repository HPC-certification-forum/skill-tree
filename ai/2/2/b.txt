# AI2.2 Scaling and Inference Optimization

This skill explores techniques for scaling AI inference across HPC systems and optimizing throughput and latency. It includes performance tuning, parallelism, model simplification, and the use of hardware accelerators.

## Requirements

* External: Basic understanding of AI inference and performance bottlenecks
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe methods to parallelize inference across multiple compute nodes or GPUs.
* Identify and apply model optimization techniques such as pruning, quantization, and distillation.
* Explain how to balance latency, throughput, and resource usage in production environments.
* Evaluate the impact of batch size, I/O overhead, and memory footprint on inference performance.
* Use profiling tools to locate bottlenecks and improve inference efficiency in HPC workflows.
