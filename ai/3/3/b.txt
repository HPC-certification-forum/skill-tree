# AI3.3 Audio and Voice Models

This skill introduces models designed to process audio signals and voice data, including spectrogram-based models, recurrent architectures, and transformers. It emphasizes preprocessing, training techniques, and deployment challenges in HPC environments.

## Requirements

* External: Familiarity with signal processing concepts and neural networks
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe preprocessing techniques used to transform raw audio into model-ready formats (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs).
* Compare model architectures suited for audio and voice tasks (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, transformers).
* Explain challenges in training audio models at scale, such as input length variability and I/O throughput.
* Evaluate model performance across metrics like accuracy, latency, and noise robustness.
* Demonstrate how to optimize audio inference on HPC systems using batching and compression.
