# AI5.3 Agentic Interfaces and Collaboration

This skill explores AI systems designed to act as agentsâ€”capable of multi-step reasoning, memory, and collaboration with users or other agents. It includes the architecture, behavior models, and interface strategies used to implement intelligent and adaptive workflows.

## Requirements

* External: Understanding of basic prompting and LLM capabilities
* Internal: AI5.1 Prompt Engineering (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Define agentic interfaces and describe their role in structured decision-making and automation.
* Differentiate between tool-using, memory-enabled, and collaborative agent types.
* Describe the looped reasoning and execution cycles used by AI agents.
* Identify strategies for agent evaluation, feedback integration, and task adaptation.
* Apply best practices for integrating agents into interactive or multi-agent HPC workflows.
