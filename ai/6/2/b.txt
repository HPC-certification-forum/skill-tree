# AI6.2 Building AI APIs

This skill focuses on exposing AI models as APIs to support integration, automation, and user interaction. It covers API design, containerization, deployment, and scalability in HPC or hybrid cloud environments.

## Requirements

* External: Experience with Python and web frameworks (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Design RESTful APIs for AI model inference, including input/output schema definition.
* Implement API endpoints to expose model functionality securely and efficiently.
* Containerize API services using tools like Docker or Singularity for deployment.
* Deploy APIs in scalable environments using orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Slurm).
* Monitor, log, and benchmark API performance in production.
