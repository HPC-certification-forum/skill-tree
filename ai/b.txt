# AI Artificial intelligence

Using Artificial intelligence software and also deploying it is becoming more and more relevant.
This is also true for deploying models in an HPC system and offering it as a service.

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain the function and design of intelligent agents in HPC-based AI systems and investigate scalability.
* Summarize techniques for fine-tuning AI models, considering performance and resource constraints.
* Describe the requirements and challenges of hosting AI models in HPC or hybrid infrastructure.
* Explain the principles of resource-aware AI deployment, including compute, memory, and energy considerations.
* Summarize techniques used in different models for processing and deployment.
* Identify key regulatory and legal frameworks relevant to AI usage and data handling and also identify principles of responsible AI use.
* Explain how retrieval-augmented generation improves accuracy and grounding in generative systems.
* Describe how AI services are developed and delivered via APIs.
