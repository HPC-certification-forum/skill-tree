# BDA3.2 Object Storage for Big Data

This skill introduces object storage systems designed for scalability, durability, and ease of access in big data environments. It covers access patterns, API usage, and integration with HPC and cloud-based workflows.

## Requirements

* External: Familiarity with data formats and file access in distributed systems
* Internal: None

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain the concept of object storage and how it differs from file/block storage.
* Identify popular object storage platforms (e.g., S3, Ceph, MinIO) and their use cases in big data.
* Describe data access mechanisms including REST APIs, SDKs, and CLI tools.
* Evaluate performance considerations such as consistency, latency, and throughput.
* Integrate object storage into HPC data pipelines using connectors or abstraction layers.
