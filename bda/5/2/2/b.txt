# BDA5.2.2 Neural Network Architectures

This skill introduces major neural network architectures used across domains such as image processing, sequence modeling, and large-scale representation learning. It emphasizes the use cases, design patterns, and performance considerations of each.

## Requirements

* External: Understanding of neural network basics
* Internal: BDA5.2.1 Basics of Neural Networks (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe the architecture and applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* Explain how recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs process sequential data.
* Understand the transformer architecture and its impact on modern AI models.
* Compare trade-offs among architectures in terms of complexity, performance, and parallelism.
* Select appropriate architectures based on task type and data modality.
