# BDA5.3.1 Pytorch

This skill introduces the PyTorch framework for developing and training machine learning and deep learning models. It emphasizes model definition, training loops, and debugging in a dynamic computation graph environment.

## Requirements

* External: Programming experience with Python
* Internal: BDA5.2.1 Basics of Neural Networks (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Define and train neural networks using the PyTorch nn.Module interface.
* Implement forward passes, loss computation, and backward propagation.
* Use DataLoader and Dataset classes to efficiently handle input data.
* Apply GPU acceleration and mixed precision with PyTorch utilities.
* Debug models interactively using PyTorchâ€™s dynamic computation graph.
