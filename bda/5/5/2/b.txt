# BDA5.5.2 Distributed Hyperparameter Search

This skill focuses on running hyperparameter tuning jobs in parallel across multiple compute nodes or GPUs. It includes orchestration tools, job scheduling integration, and best practices for large-scale experimentation in HPC settings.

## Requirements

* External: Understanding of hyperparameter tuning strategies and batch job submission
* Internal: BDA5.5.1 Hyperparameter Search Methods (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain the benefits and challenges of distributing hyperparameter search in HPC environments.
* Use orchestration tools such as Ray Tune, Optuna, or Hyperopt for parallel execution.
* Integrate distributed tuning with HPC schedulers like Slurm or PBS.
* Monitor, resume, and manage many concurrent tuning jobs.
* Optimize compute resource usage to balance speed, cost, and coverage.
