# BDA5.5.3 Early Stopping and Pruning Strategies

This skill introduces methods to halt underperforming model runs early during training or tuning. It focuses on decision rules, integration with tuning frameworks, and efficiency improvements in HPC resource usage.

## Requirements

* External: Experience with model evaluation and validation techniques
* Internal: BDA5.5.1 Hyperparameter Search Methods (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Define early stopping and its role in improving training efficiency.
* Describe criteria such as validation loss plateaus or metric stagnation.
* Apply pruning strategies to terminate weak candidates during hyperparameter search.
* Integrate early stopping with tuning frameworks and logging systems.
* Evaluate trade-offs between training completeness and resource savings.
