# BDA5.5.4 Resource Aware Tuning

This skill focuses on hyperparameter tuning strategies that account for resource constraints in HPC environments. It includes adaptive scheduling, prioritization, and energy-aware optimization techniques.

## Requirements

* External: Basic understanding of HPC scheduling and tuning processes
* Internal: BDA5.5.1 Hyperparameter Search Methods (recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain how resource availability and cost influence tuning strategy selection.
* Use adaptive or multi-fidelity tuning approaches to allocate compute efficiently.
* Apply constraints on runtime, memory, or energy usage in tuning campaigns.
* Integrate resource metrics into scheduling or pruning decisions.
* Evaluate tuning success with respect to both model performance and resource efficiency.
