# K1.2.1 Processing elements


## Learning Outcomes

* Understand elementary processing elements like CPUs, GPUs, many-core architectures
* Understand vector systems, and FPGAs
* Understand the NUMA architecture used for symmetric multiprocessing systems where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor
* Comprehend that in traditional **CPUs** - although CPU stands for Central Processing Unit - there is no central, i.e. single, processing unit any more because today all CPUs have multiple compute cores which all have the same functionality
* Comprehend that **GPUs** (Graphical Processing Units) or **GPGPUs** (General Purpose Graphical Processing Units) were originally used for image processing and displaying images on screens before people started to utilize the computing power of GPUs for other purposes
* Comprehend that **FPGAs** (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are devices that have configurable hardware and configurations are specified by hardware description languages
* Comprehend that **FPGAs** are interesting if one uses them to implement hardware features that are not available in CPUs or GPUs (e.g. low precision arithmetic that needs only a few bits)
* Comprehend that **Vector units** are successors of vector computers (i.e. the first generation of supercomputers) and that they are supposed to provide higher memory bandwidth than CPUs
* Comprehend that at an abstract level the high-speed network connects compute units and main memory which leads to three main parallel computer architectures
    * **Shared Memory** where all compute units can directly access the whole main memory
    * **Distributed memory** where individual computers are connected with a network
    * **NUMA** (Non-Uniform Memory Access) combines properties from shared and distributed memory systems, because at the hardware level a NUMA system resembles a distributed memory
* Comprehend that in general, the effort for programming parallel applications for distributed systems is higher than for shared memory systems
* Understand parallelization techniques at the instruction level of a processing element (e.g. pipelining, SIMD processing)
* Understand advanced instruction sets that improve parallelization (e.g., AVX-512)
* Understand hybrid approaches, e.g. combining CPUs with GPUs or FPGAs 
* Understand typical network topologies and architectures used for HPC systems, like fat trees based on switched fabrics using e.g. fast Ethernet (1 or 10 Gbit) or InfiniBand 
* Understand special or application-specific hardware (e.g. TPUs)
