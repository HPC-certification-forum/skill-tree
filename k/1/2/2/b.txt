# K1.2.2 Network

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand Demands 
* Understand Topologies 
* Understand Interconnects 
* Comprehend that at an abstract level the high-speed network connects compute units and main memory which leads to three main parallel computer architectures
    * **Shared Memory** where all compute units can directly access the whole main memory
    * **Distributed memory** where individual computers are connected with a network
    * **NUMA** (Non-Uniform Memory Access) combines properties from shared and distributed memory systems, because at the hardware level a NUMA system resembles a distributed memory
