# K1.3.1.5 Overview Parallel I/O

Parallel I/O allows each processor in a multi-processor system to read and write data from multiple processes to a common file independently.

Data-intensive scientific applications use parallel I/O software to access files.
In HPC, increasing demands in the I/O system can cause bottlenecks. Parallel I/O plays a fundamental role to balance the fast increase in computational power and the progress of processor architectures.
