# K1.3.2.3.1-B Overview
# Background
There are **Local file systems**, **Distributed (or network) file systems**, and **Parallel (or cluster) file systems** used in cluster systems.

# Aim

# Outcomes
  * Comprehend that **Local file systems** can be provided on nodes that are equipped with disks but only the node itself can access its disk.
  * Comprehend that **Local file systems** are useful for (heavy) scratch I/O because the I/O performance scales perfectly with the number of nodes.
  * Comprehend that there are also disadvantages of using **Local file systems**:
    * For an overall view data has to be collected from all the nodes it is stored on.
    * Disks are a major source of failures (so many clusters have diskless nodes).
