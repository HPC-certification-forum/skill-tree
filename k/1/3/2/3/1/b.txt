# K1.3.2.3.1-B Overview
# Background
There are Local file Systems, Distributed (or network) file systems, and Parallel (or cluster) file systems used in cluster systems.

# Aim

# Outcomes
  * Comprehend that **Local file systems** can be provided on nodes that are equipped with disks but only the node itself can access its disk
  * Comprehend that Local file systems are useful for (heavy) scratch I/O because the I/O performance scales perfectly with the number of nodes
  * Comprehend that there are also disadvantages of using Local file systems
    * for an overall view data has to be collected from all the nodes it is stored on 
    * disks are a major source of failures (so many clusters have diskless nodes)
