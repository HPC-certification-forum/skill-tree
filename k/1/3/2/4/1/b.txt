# K1.3.2.4.1-B NetCDF
# Background

NetCDF is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. It is commonly used in climatology, meteorology, oceanography applications (e.g., weather forecasting, climate change) and GIS applications.
NetCDF allows the user to describe multidimensional data and include metadata which further characterizes the data.

The notation used to describe a NetCDF object is called CDL (network Common Data form Language), which provides a convenient way of describing NetCDF datasets. The NetCDF system includes utilities for producing human-oriented CDL text files from binary NetCDF datasets and vice-versa.

This skill focuses on the data modeling aspect and basic tools that aid in understanding NetCDF.

# Aim

  * To create, analyze, and visualize a data model for NetCDF data.
  * To utilize the core software ecosystem of NetCDF.

# Outcomes

  * Describe the Classic NetCDF Model characteristics and limitations.
  * Describe how a 3D-variable’s data values can be represented in a visualization tool.
  * Discuss features of the Enhanced Data Model (NetCDF-4): groups, multiple unlimited dimensions, and new types, including user-defined types.
  * Analyze the implications of using NetCDF-4 compression on data.
  * Justify when to model data using variables or attributes based on characteristics.
  * Design and implement a NetCDF data model in CDL text notation for simple datasets using dimensions, variables, attributes, and coordinate variables.
  * Apply the in-built NetCDF utilities to create and analyze NetCDF files:
    * Examine the CDL data model and the data of a file using ncdump.
    * Generate a NetCDF file from a CDL text file using ncgen.
    * Convert a NetCDF file from one binary format to another, optionally changing compression and chunk size settings using nccopy.
