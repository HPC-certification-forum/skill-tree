# K2.2 Bounds for a Parallel Program

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain how performance bounds of the various components of the HPC system (e.g. CPU, caches, memory) can limit the overall performance of a parallel program.
* Explain how performance bounds of the various components of the HPC system (e.g. network, I/O) can limit the overall performance of a parallel program.
