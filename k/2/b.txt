# K2 Performance Modeling

HPC systems are massively parallel and therefore sophisticated parallel programs are required to exploit their performance potential as much as possible, including but not limited to modeling the I/O performance.

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe how the performance of parallel programs may be assessed.
* Describe bounds for the performance of parallel programs.
* Describe different performance characteristics.

## Subskills

* [[skill-tree:k:2:1:b]]
* [[skill-tree:k:2:2:b]]
* [[skill-tree:k:2:3:b]]
