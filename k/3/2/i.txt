# K3.3-I Parallelization Overheads
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  *  the overheads caused by redundant computations
  *  the problems of execution speed noise (OS jitter, cache contention, thermal throttling, etc.), and typical trade-offs (e.g. reducing the synchronization overhead by increasing the communication overhead)
