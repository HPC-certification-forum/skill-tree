# K3 Program Parallelization

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe the typical parallelization techniques used at the intra- and inter-node level of cluster systems.
* Discuss the causes of parallelization overheads, which eventually prevent efficient use of an increasing number of processing elements.
* Apply domain decomposition strategies (i.e. splitting a problem into pieces that allow for parallel computation).
* Apply Autoparallelization to a program.
