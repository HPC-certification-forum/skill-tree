# K3 Overview: Program Parallelization

## Learning Outcomes
  * Describe the typical parallelization techniques used at the intra- and inter-node level of cluster systems.
  * Discuss the causes of parallelization overheads, which eventually prevent efficient use of an increasing number of processing elements.
  * Apply domain decomposition strategies (i.e. splitting a problem into pieces that allow for parallel computation).
