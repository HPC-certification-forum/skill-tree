# K4.3 Scheduling strategies

## Learning Outcomes

* Comprehend accounting principles (billing for the jobs).
* Comprehend the set of terms for performance criteria like:
      * Resource Utilization.
      * Throughput.
      * Waiting Time.
      * Execution Time.
      * Turnaround Time.
* Comprehend scheduling strategies that increase productivity.
* Comprehend that typical goals of job scheduling are:
      * Maximization of resource utilization.
      * Maximization of throughput.
      * Minimization of waiting time.
      * Minimization of turnaround time.
* Comprehend that there is a variety of scheduling algorithms from rather simple to more complex like:
      * First-Come-First-Served (FCFS).
      * Shortest-Job-First (SJF).
      * Priority-based.
      * Fair-Share.
      * Backfilling.
* Apply advanced scheduling principles (e.g. backfilling) to achieve objectives like minimizing the averaged elapsed program runtimes, and maximizing the utilization of the available HPC resources.
* Discuss sophisticated scheduling principles (e.g. fair share) to achieve objectives like treating the users fair, and maximizing the utilization of the available HPC resources.
