# K7.5 Quantum-HPC Integration (K7.5)

This skill explores how quantum computing is being integrated into high-performance computing environments. Learners will examine hybrid approaches that combine classical and quantum resources, focusing on quantum simulators, cloud-based access to quantum processors, and integration into HPC job schedulers. Case studies highlight applications in chemistry, optimization, and machine learning where HPC+quantum workflows are being tested. The skill emphasizes both the opportunities and the practical limitations of current integration strategies.
