# K HPC Knowledge

The theoretical knowledge of HPC provides the background to understand how supercomputers and HPC environments operate.
This enables practitioners to effectively use such environments.

## Learning Outcomes

* Explain the hardware, software, and operation of HPC systems.
* Construct and judge simple performance models for systems and applications.
* Understand that there are performance frontiers.
* Compare different paradigms for the parallelization of applications.
* Construct and execute an HPC workflow on an HPC system.
* Comprehend job scheduling principles.
* Apply a cost model to compute the costs for running a workflow on an HPC system.
* Discuss data management plans.
