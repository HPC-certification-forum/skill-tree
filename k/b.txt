# K-B HPC Knowledge
# Background
The theoretical knowledge of HPC provides the background to understand how supercomputers and HPC environments operate.
This enables practitioners to effectively use such environments.

# Aims
  * To provide background knowledge that is relevant for all other branches.
  * To provide theoretical background to judge the behavior and efficiency of systems.
  * To provide technical understanding of HPC systems

# Outcomes
  * Explain the hardware, software, and operation of HPC systems
  * Construct and judge simple performance models for systems and applications
  * Understand that there are performance frontiers
  * Explain why it is a special challenge to achieve good speedups and good efficiencies if the number of processing elements is steadily increased
  * Compare different paradigms for the parallelization of applications
  * Construct and execute an HPC workflow on an HPC system
  * Comprehend job scheduling principles
  * Apply a cost model to compute the costs for running a workflow on an HPC system
