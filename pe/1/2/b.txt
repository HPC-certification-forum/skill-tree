# PE1.2 Total Cost of Ownership

Understanding the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is crucial for making informed decisions in performance engineering. This course dives into the comprehensive accounting of all costs associated with the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of engineering assets.

## Requirements

## Learning Objectives

1. **Define the concept** of Total Cost of Ownership and its relevance to performance engineering.
2. **Identify all components** that contribute to the TCO of engineering projects, including hidden and indirect costs.
3. **Calculate TCO** for various engineering assets using structured financial models.
4. **Analyze case studies** to illustrate the impact of TCO on project decision-making and long-term sustainability.
5. **Evaluate different purchasing strategies** and their effects on TCO, including lease vs. buy decisions.
6. **Assess the influence** of maintenance and operational practices on the TCO of assets.
7. **Compare TCO** across different technology solutions to determine the most cost-effective choice.
8. **Develop a strategic approach** to minimize TCO through efficient design, procurement, and asset management techniques.
9. **Utilize software tools** and frameworks to automate TCO calculations and provide actionable insights.
10. **Forecast long-term costs** and benefits associated with different project options to guide strategic planning.
11. **Interpret financial reports** and data to enhance TCO-based decision-making.
