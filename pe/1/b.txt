# PE1 Cost Awareness

Cost awareness is a crucial aspect of Performance Engineering (PE), focusing on understanding the economic implications of performance optimization decisions in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments. In this overview, we explore the importance of cost awareness, considering factors such as time to solution constraints and the total cost of ownership.

**Time To Solution Constraints (PE2.2):** Time to solution constraints refers to the limitations imposed by deadlines or time-sensitive requirements on completing computational tasks within specified time frames. This branch examines techniques for estimating the costs associated with missing time to solution constraints, including potential revenue loss, project delays, and missed opportunities. Understanding time to solution constraints enables organizations to prioritize performance optimization efforts and meet critical deadlines effectively.

**Total Cost of Ownership (PE2.3):** The total cost of ownership (TCO) encompasses all direct and indirect costs associated with acquiring, deploying, and maintaining HPC infrastructure over its entire lifecycle. This section explores methodologies for calculating TCO, including initial investment costs, operational expenses, maintenance costs, and end-of-life disposal costs. Mastery of TCO analysis enables organizations to make informed decisions about HPC investments, optimize resource allocation, and minimize long-term costs while maximizing value.

By incorporating cost awareness into performance engineering practices, organizations can align performance optimization efforts with budget constraints, prioritize investments based on cost-effectiveness, and achieve better overall efficiency and return on investment in HPC environments.
