# PE2.2.2.2-B Scalasca
#### Maintainer: Marc-Andr√© Hermanns, HPC Group, IT Center, RWTH Aachen University

# Background

Analyzing detailed event traces and identifying performance problems and their root causes can be challenging.
Scalasca automatically searches for patterns of inefficient behavior in OTF2 traces collected with Score-P and identifies the time a thread or process is waiting in an interaction with another thread or process.
Furthermore, it helps in identifying the root causes of those waiting times by determining imbalances in the program, highlighting the part of the code and processes/threads that contribute the most to any waiting time found.

# Aim

Students should learn how to apply Scalasca to OTF2 tracing data as collected by Score-P.
Moreover, they should learn how to identify waiting time in the application and their root causes, to create ideas on how to resolve them.

# Outcomes

* Able to automatically run Score-P instrumented measurements (including automatic
  analysis) of applications containing
  - MPI, and 
  - OpenMP and/or Pthreads.
* Able to identify waiting time in the application measurement
* Able to identify the causing delay (imbalance) causing waiting time
* Derive solution hypotheses from the analysis report to resolve the
  performance problems identified.
