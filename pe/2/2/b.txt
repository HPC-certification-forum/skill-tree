# PE2.2-B
# Name: Profiling
# Background
  *  Profiling is explained for the CPU level, where it can be supported by hardware performance counters and by sampling techniques. 
  *  Sampling is used to see, by examining the program counter, what routines and source code lines of a program are responsible for which portions of the total runtime. 
  *  Automatically adding trace code to a parallel program by so-called instrumentation to record its execution in a strict chronology is explained and the difference to profiling is emphasized. 
  *  Similar techniques are explained for profiling the network level (e.g. based on InfiniBand counters and I/O server states). 
# Learning objectives
# Outcomes
  *  detect performance issues and bottlenecks caused, for example, by inefficient programming, memory accesses, I/O operations, cache-misses, page-faults, and parallelization overheads 
  *  use environment variables like $I_MPI_STATS to control the built-in performance analysis functionality in MPI
