# PE3 Overview: Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the activity to measure performance reliably and to assess the obtained performance.

A benchmark is an act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.

Such a controlled experiment is named a benchmark, but the term is also used – apparent from the context – for the program that is, or set of programs that are used for benchmarking.

For HPC users measuring the performance behavior of the parallel program(s) they use is of primary importance in order to make optimal use of HPC hardware.
