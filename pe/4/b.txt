# PE4 Tuning

Tuning means to change some system variables/configurations (without changing the program itself) in order to optimize the performance.

## Learning Outcomes

* Analyze the IO performance of a program and tune it to increase performance.
* Use profiling tools such as prof, gprof and line-by-line profilers.
* Define Amdahl's Law.
* Tune a parallel program in order to achieve better runtimes and to optimize the usage of the HPC resources.
