# SD1.2.2-B Shared Memory Systems
# Background
The parallel concepts of threads and processes are introduced and their impacts on performance are outlined.

# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Detect race conditions and use synchronization mechanisms to avoid them.
  * Estimate the problems that may result from erroneous use of synchronization mechanisms (e.g. deadlocks).
  * Assess data dependency situations, i.e. an instruction reading the data written by a preceding instruction in the source code, and anti dependencies, i.e. an instruction having to read data before a succeeding instruction overwrites it, and output dependencies, i.e. instructions writing to the same memory location.
  * Use data parallelism, e.g. applying parallel streams of identical instructions to different elements of appropriate data structures such as arrays.
  * Apply the concept of functional parallelism, i.e. executing a set of distinct functions possibly using the same data.
  * Assess the applicability of parallel language extensions like OpenMP.
