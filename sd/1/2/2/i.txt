# SD1.2.2-I Programming Shared Memory Systems
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Assess parallel concepts typically used for shared memory systems, e.g. to exploit temporal locality by data reuse with an efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy.
  * Assess concepts like software pipelining, and vectorization principles.
  * Assess the influence of control dependencies by jumps, branches, and function calls, e.g. on pipeline filling.
  * Assess the applicability of parallel language extensions like OpenACC, and C++ AMP.
