# SD1.2.3-B Programming Message Passing Systems
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Describe the various communication modes (e.g. blocking vs. non-blocking, point-to-point vs. collective).
  * Develop programs using MPI as the de-facto standard for parallelizing programs in distributed environments like HPC cluster systems.
  * Detect how race conditions and deadlocks may occur in MPI parallelized programs and how they can be avoided, namely by reordering send and receive operations or using non-blocking communication combined with waiting for completion of the communication operations concerned.
  * Assess the impact of communication and synchronization on the performance of a parallel program.
