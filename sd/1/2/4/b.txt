# SD1.2.4 Load Balancing

## Learning Outcomes

* Apply domain decomposition strategies.
* Apply simple scheduling algorithms like task farming to achieve an appropriate distribution of the workloads across the multiple computing resources of the HPC system.
* Apply domain decomposition strategies.
* Apply more sophisticated approaches e.g. based on tree structures like divide-and-conquer or work-stealing to achieve an appropriate distribution of the workloads across the multiple computing resources of the HPC system.
