# SD1.2.5.1.1.1-B NetCDF C API
# Background

The C library is the core implementation on which non-Java interfaces are built.
It provides reliability, performance, and portability.

# Aim

  * To use C for working with NetCDF data.
  * To apply the main information available in the NetCDF C Interface Guide.
  * To exploit the strengths of the NetCDF C API:
    * Comprehensively tested: many tests are run when the NetCDF C library is installed from source.
    * Well supported: answers for many common support questions are readily available.
    * Mature: the C interface has many users on many platforms, enhancing its reliability and portability.
    * Well documented: the NetCDF C Interface Guide is complete, and reference documentation is maintained in Unix man-page form.
    * Useful with ncgen: from CDL, ncgen can generate C code needed to create the corresponding NetCDF file.

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
  * Employ ncgen to generate the C code needed to create the corresponding NetCDF file from a CDL text file.
