# SD1.2.5.1.1.10-B NetCDF Ruby API
# Background

RubyNetCDF is basically a one-to-one interface to the original NetCDF library, but it:
  * Consolidates some functions having same purposes, and
  * Supports some additional functions to help users by combining the raw functions.

The Ruby API for NetCDF was contributed as part of the Dennou Ruby Project, providing software for data analyses, visualization, and numerical simulations for geophysical studies.
RubyNetCDF supports all the functionality of the NetCDF-3 C library.

# Aim

  * To use Ruby for working with NetCDF data.
  * To apply the main information available in the RubyNetCDF Reference Manual.
  * To exploit the strengths of the NetCDF Rubi API:
    * Very concise
    * Supports OPeNDAP remote access
    * Makes available combination functions such as iterators (which offer abstract ways to scan files and variables)
    * Supports efficient multidimensional numeric arrays with the NArray library, the de facto Ruby standard
    * Handles packed data specified by scale_factor and add_offset attributes

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
