# SD1.2.5.1.1.2-B NetCDF C++ API
# Background

The NetCDF-4 C++ API was developed by Lynton Appel, of the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) in Oxfordshire, for use in managing fusion research data from CCFE's innovative MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) experiment.

The new API is implemented as a layer over the NetCDF-4 C interface, which means bug fixes and performance enhancements in the C interface will be immediately available to C++ developers as well.

# Aim

  * To use C++ for working with NetCDF data
  * To apply the main information available in the NetCDF C++ Interface Guide
  * To exploit the strengths of the NetCDF C++ API:
    * Object-oriented interface
    * Type safety: better than the C interface.
    * Less code than an equivalent C program, and it's object-oriented.
    * Short argument lists, because there are no IDs for variables, dimensions, or attributes.
    * Easier memory management, because space for blocks of data is allocated by the library.
    * Hides "define mode", so no calls are needed to enter or leave define mode for changing the schema of a NetCDF file (adding variables, dimensions, or attributes).

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file
