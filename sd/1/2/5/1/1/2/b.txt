# SD1.2.5.1.1.2-B NetCDF C++ API
# Background

The NetCDF-4 C++ API was for using in managing fusion research data from CCFE's innovative MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) experiment.

The API is implemented as a layer over the NetCDF-4 C interface, which means bug fixes and performance enhancements in the C interface will be immediately available to C++ developers as well.

# Aim

  * To use C++ for working with NetCDF data.
  * To apply the main information available in the NetCDF C++ Interface Guide.
  * To exploit the strengths of the NetCDF C++ API:
    * Object-oriented interface
    * Type safety: better than the C interface.
    * Less code than an equivalent C program, and it's object-oriented.
    * Short argument lists, because there are no IDs for variables, dimensions, or attributes.
    * Easier memory management, because space for blocks of data is allocated by the library.
    * Hides "define mode", so no calls are needed to enter or leave define mode for changing the schema of a NetCDF file (adding variables, dimensions, or attributes).

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
