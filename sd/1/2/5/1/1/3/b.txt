# SD1.2.5.1.1.3-B NetCDF Java API
# Background

The NetCDF Java library implements the Common Data Model (CDM) to interface NetCDF files to a variety of data formats (e.g., NetCDF, HDF, GRIB).
Layered above the basic data access, the CDM uses the metadata contained in datasets to provide a higher-level interface to geoscience specific features of datasets, in particular, providing geolocation and data subsetting in coordinate space.

# Aim

  * To use Java for working with NetCDF data.
  * To facilitate access to real-time data.
  * To access TDS (THREDDS Data Server) as a web server for scientific data.
  * To enable advanced network support and client-server access.

# Outcomes

  * Employ the CDM/NetCDF-Java to read datasets in various formats.
  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
