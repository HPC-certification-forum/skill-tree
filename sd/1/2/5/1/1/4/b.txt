# SD1.2.5.1.1.4-B NetCDF Fortran-90 API
# Background

The Fortran-90 library provides current Fortran support for modelers and scientists.

The Fortran-90 interface is significantly simpler than either the C or Fortran-77 interfaces because of its use of overloaded functions and optional arguments.

# Aim

  * To use Fortran-90 for working with NetCDF data.
  * To apply the main information available in the NetCDF Fortran-90 Users Guide.
  * To exploit the strengths of the NetCDF Fortran-90 API.
    * Overloaded functions and optional arguments.
    * Fewer arguments to functions.
    * Improved error checking.
    * Support for arbitrary array sections.

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
