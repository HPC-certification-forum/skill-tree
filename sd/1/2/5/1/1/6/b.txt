# SD1.2.5.1.1.6-B NetCDF Matlab API
# Background

MATLAB is a commercial integrated technical computing environment that combines numeric computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language. Versions 7.7 and later of MATLAB have built-in support for reading and writing netCDF data.

Several freely-available software packages that implement a MATLAB/netCDF interface are available: MEXNC, MexEPS, and the CSIRO MATLAB/netCDF interface. It's also possible to call netCDF Java library methods from MATLAB, so using it provides the advantages of the Java interface.

# Aim

  * To use Matlab for working with NetCDF data

# Outcomes

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file
