# SD1.2.5.1.10 NetCDF Ruby API

RubyNetCDF is basically a one-to-one interface to the original NetCDF library, but it:
  * Consolidates some functions having same purposes.
  * Supports some additional functions to help users by combining the raw functions.

The Ruby API for NetCDF was contributed as part of the Dennou Ruby Project, providing software for data analyses, visualization, and numerical simulations for geophysical studies.
RubyNetCDF supports all the functionality of the NetCDF-3 C library.

## Lerning objectives

  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
