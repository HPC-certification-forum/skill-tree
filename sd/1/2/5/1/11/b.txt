# SD1.2.5.1.11 NetCDF Perl API

There are two Perl APIs for NetCDF:
  * PDL::NetCDF, an object-oriented interface between NetCDF files and PDL objects.
  * NetCDFPerl, developed at Unidata, but now in maintenance mode only, and no further development is currently planned.

## Learning Outcomes

* Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
* Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
* Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
