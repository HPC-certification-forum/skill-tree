# SD1.2.5.1.13 NetCDF Principles

In a simple view, NetCDF is:
    * A data model.
    * A file format.
    * A set of APIs and libraries for various programming languages.

Together, the data model, file format, and APIs support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

## Learning Outcomes

* Comply with the best practices for writing NetCDF files.
* Identify protocols, servers, and clients for remote data access through NetCDF interfaces.
* Discuss how features of the enhanced NetCDF-4 format can be applied:
    * Groups.
    * Multiple unlimited dimensions.
    * User-defined types.
    * Data compression.
* Create short programs in C that use the NetCDF API to read and write files in the NetCDF classical data model for a given NetCDF data model.
* Create short programs that use the netcdf4-python module to create and read files in NetCDF-4 format for a given NetCDF data model.
