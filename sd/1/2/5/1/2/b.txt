# SD1.2.5.1.2 NetCDF C++ API

The NetCDF-4 C++ API was for using in managing fusion research data from CCFE's innovative MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) experiment.

The API is implemented as a layer over the NetCDF-4 C interface, which means bug fixes and performance enhancements in the C interface will be immediately available to C++ developers as well.
