# SD1.2.5.1.3 NetCDF Java API

The NetCDF Java library implements the Common Data Model (CDM) to interface NetCDF files to a variety of data formats (e.g., NetCDF, HDF, GRIB).
Layered above the basic data access, the CDM uses the metadata contained in datasets to provide a higher-level interface to geoscience specific features of datasets, in particular, providing geolocation and data subsetting in coordinate space.

## Learning Outcomes

  * Employ the CDM/NetCDF-Java to read datasets in various formats.
  * Write a two-dimensional array of sample data and read data from this file.
  * Write some variables with units attributes and coordinate dimensions and read data variables and attributes from this file.
  * Write some four-dimensional variables using a record dimension and read from the variables from this file.
