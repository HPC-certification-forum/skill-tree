# SD1.2.5.1.6 NetCDF Matlab API

MATLAB is a commercial integrated technical computing environment that combines numeric computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language.
Versions 7.7 and later of MATLAB have built-in support for reading and writing NetCDF data.

Several freely-available software packages that implement a MATLAB/NetCDF interface are available: MEXNC, MexEPS, and the CSIRO MATLAB/NetCDF interface.
It is also possible to call NetCDF Java library methods from MATLAB, so using it provides the advantages of the Java interface.

## Learning Outcomes
