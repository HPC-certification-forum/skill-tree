# SD1.2.5.1.8 NetCDF NCL API

NCL (NCAR Command Language) is a free interpreted language designed specifically for scientific data processing and visualization.
In addition to common programming features, NCL also handles manipulation of metadata, configuration of the visualizations, import of data from a variety of data formats (including NetCDF, HDF4, HDF4-EOS, GRIB1, GRIB2) via a single function, and an algebra that supports array operations.
