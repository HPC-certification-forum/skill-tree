# SD1.2.5.1 Overview: NetCDF

In a simple view, NetCDF is:
    * A data model.
    * A file format.
    * A set of APIs and libraries for various programming languages.

Together, the data model, file format, and APIs support the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

NetCDF APIs are available for most programming languages used in geosciences.
Although the NetCDF data model and format are language-independent, all NetCDF APIs are currently implemented over C or Java.
Files written through one language API are readable through other language APIs and some language interfaces support remote access.

Languages such as C++, Fortran-77, Fortran-90, Perl, Python, Ruby, Matlab, among others, have C-based interfaces.
In particular, NetCDF4-python is a Python interface to the NetCDF C library.
