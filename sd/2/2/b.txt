# SD2.2-B Debugging
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Debug a program using simple techniques such as inserting debugging output statements into the source code, e.g. using printf â€“ also against the background of potential problems with the ordering of the (stdout) output that may exist in parallel environments like MPI.
  * Apply the common concepts and workflows when using a debugger (commands like step into, step over, step out, breakpoints).
  * Use sophisticated debuggers such as GDB.
