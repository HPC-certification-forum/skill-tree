# SD2.5 Exception Handling

The skill conveys general concepts about exception handling, how exception handling can be implemented in a specific programming language and how a consistent exception handling policy can be defined and thoroughly followed during implementation.

## Learning objectives
  * Differentiate among the terms "mistake", "fault", "failure", and "error".
  * Describe exception handling concepts in general (e.g. Errors vs. Exceptions).
  * Articulate why it helps to write software that is robust.
  * Use best practices for exception handling.
  * Describe how exception handling is supported in a specific programming language, e.g. Fortran, C (e.g. <errno.h>), C++ (i.e. try, catch, throw).
  * Apply appropriate exception handling in a specific programming language.
