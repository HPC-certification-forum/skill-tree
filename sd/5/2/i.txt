# SD5.2-I Code Quality
# Background
# Aim
# Outcomes
  * Assess code quality using different metrics, e.g. length of functions, length of files, lines of code, complexity metrics, code coverage.
  * Use static code analysis tools in order to calculate the metrics (e.g. http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/).
  * Identify bad code structures (known as bad smells) in order to assess the quality of the code design.
