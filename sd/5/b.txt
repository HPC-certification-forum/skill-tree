# SD5 Software Quality

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand Coding Standards
* Understand Code Quality
    * Apply software engineering methods and practices especially in the context of high-performance computing.
    * Develop parallel programs and to apply software engineering methods and best practices.
    * Assess code quality using different metrics, e.g. length of functions, length of files, lines of code, complexity metrics, code coverage.
    * Use static code analysis tools in order to calculate the metrics (e.g. http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/).
    * Identify bad code structures (known as bad smells) in order to assess the quality of the code design.
* Understand Refactoring
    * Apply common code refactorings in order to improve code quality, such as extract method, extract class, rename class and when it is suitable to apply which refactoring.
    * Apply refactoring that are specific to programming languages (e.g. Fortran).
* Understand Code Reviews
    * Use a review system like Gerrit to organize the code reviews.
    * Document code review results and resulting tasks in an issue tracking system (for example Jira).
    * Define checklists for code reviews.
    * Conduct code reviews in pairs or in a team.
    * Document code review results and resulting tasks in an issue tracking system (for example Jira).
    * Demonstrate awareness of technical debt during software development and how to pay technical debt.
