# SD8 Overview: Workflow Management Systems

Workflow Management Systems are basic tools for reproducible data analysis, especially if many data analyis steps are involved.

Workflow Management Systems cover all data analysis from A to Z, e.g. data preprocessing, quality filtering, analysis and statistical evaluation of processed data. This may include, starting jobs, staging data to compute nodes, running the computations, deleting temporary data, generating publication ready reports, archiving and cleaning work environments.

There are some Workflow Management Systems, such as Nextflow or Snakemake, which are designed to automate this process on HPC Clusters.

## Learning objectives
  * Understanding the purpose and benefits of a Worfkflow Management System
  * Understanding Snakemake workflow structure: Familiarity with rules, input/output files, and directives like `shell`, `script`, `run`, and resources.
  * Software Deployment: Ensuring automatic software deployment with Conda or software provisioning with Apptainer/Singularity or module files.
  * Writing maintainable workflows: Understanding how to build modular workflows.
  * Advanced resource management: Setting up workflow-specific resources (e.g., memory, CPU, or cluster configurations).
  * Custom Python scripts: Integrating Python scripts for quick data manipulation or dynamic resource parameterization.
  * Error handling and troubleshooting: Identifying and addressing failed jobs, viewing logs, and restarting workflows from failed steps.
