# USE1.3 UNIX File System Tree

The UNIX file system is organized hierarchically according to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

UNIX follows the philosophy that everything is a file. Directories are indicated with a "/" separator and start from the root directory "/" and different devices are linked to this tree.

Files and directories can be referred to either using absolute or relative file names.

Typically, several elementary programs are pre-installed and allow access and manipulation of files and directories.
