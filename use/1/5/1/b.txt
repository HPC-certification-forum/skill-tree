# USE1.5.1 Environment Modules

The Environment Modules package is a widely used tool for managing information (module files) about installed software.
It comes with integration into the shell.

## Requirements

## Learning Outcomes

* Comprehend that Modules can have dependencies and conflicts:
    * A Module can enforce other Modules that it depends on must be loaded before the Module itself can be loaded.
    * Conflicting modules must not be loaded at the same time (e.g. two versions of a compiler).
* Query information about packages:
    * list
    * avail
    * whatis
    * search
    * display
    * help
* Load/Unload software modules:
    * load/unload
    * purge
    * swap
    * switch
* Describe the MODULEPATH variable.
* Describe the general dependency structure of software.
* Describe how a package manager makes software available.
* Understand shell variables relevant for executing and building software:
    * PATH for executables
    * LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH for libraries
    * MANPATH for manual pages (man command)
    * PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH for pkg-config
* Manipulate shell variables to include additional software:
    * Setting shell variables for a single program by prefixing or by using export.
