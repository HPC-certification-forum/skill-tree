# USE1.5.1 Environment Modules

The Environment Modules package is a widely used tool for managing information (module files) about installed software.
It comes with integration into the shell.

## Requirements

## Learning Objectives
  * Comprehend that Modules can have dependencies and conflicts:
    * A Module can enforce other Modules that it depends on must be loaded before the Module itself can be loaded.
    * Conflicting modules must not be loaded at the same time (e.g. two versions of a compiler).
  * Query information about packages:
    * list
    * avail
    * whatis
    * search
    * display
    * help
  * Load/Unload software modules:
    * load/unload
    * purge
    * swap
    * switch
  * Describe the MODULEPATH variable.
