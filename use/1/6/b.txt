# USE1.6 CLI File editors

Running programs using the CLI often also includes editing files without a GUI available.
Many programs are available and are also often suggested in tutorials and by other people.
It is of importance to being able to navigate file editing using different editors and understanding how to write files and exit the editor.

Most common editors will all be included here, meaning one should be taught and the other need to be mentioned for completeness:
    * VI/Vim
    * Emacs
    * Nano
