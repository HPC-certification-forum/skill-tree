# USE1.7 Terminal multiplexer

Sometimes running longer tasks or processes interactively can become error prone on a remote system.
A loss of network breaks the SSH connection and terminates the commands a user has running on the remote system.

This can be prevented by running terminal multiplexer.
These are programs that run on a remote system and a user can attach and detach from such a session.
All output is cached in the session and can be checked gain.
Commands that are started run in this session and are independent of the SSH connection, breaking it will only detach from the multiplexer.

Some even allow multiple users or multiple sessions of the same user to connect to them.

## Requirements

* [[skill-tree:use:1:1:b]]
* [[skill-tree:use:1:4:b]]

## Learning outcomes

* Give examples for use cases for such a multiplexer.
* Discuss using such a session for longer data transfers using SSH.
* Review editing files using a terminal multiplexer
* Utilize screen and tmux to preserve a session between logins:
    * Creation of a session.
    * Detaching from the current session.
    * Resuming a previous session.
