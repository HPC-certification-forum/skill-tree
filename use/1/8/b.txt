# USE1.8 Manage background processes and signals

Background processes are very useful to use a single bash session and run multiple programs in it.
They can either run in parallel in the background or are stopped and can be resumed later.

Similarly, sending signals to other programs in the background can be used to change the state of the program by making it active again or move a program in to the foreground.
In order to do this there exists a program called kill, which does not only kill by signal a kill.
