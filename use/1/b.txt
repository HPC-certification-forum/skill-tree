# USE1 Cluster Operating System

HPC systems are usually accessed via a Linux-based Command Line Interface (CLI).
Via the CLI, users can run programs to manipulate files, load additional software, or execute programs.

While there are many similarities to single-user Linux systems, HPC systems differ widely in the management of provided Software packages, and users must pay attention to the locality of data.
