Parallel computers are operated differently than a normal PC, all users must share the system. 
Therefore, various operative procedures are in place. 
Users must understand these concepts and procedures to be able to use the available resources of a system to run a parallel application. 
Moreover, individual solutions can often be found in a specific system.
