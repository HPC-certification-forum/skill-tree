# USE6 Workflows

Workflows are very important especially if much data movement is involved.
Workflows involve the full procedure for a compute task.
This can include, starting a job, compiling the software, moving data to the compute node, running the computation, copying the results to where they need to be, and cleaning up the work environment.
There are some programs, such as Snakemake, which are designed to automate this process.
