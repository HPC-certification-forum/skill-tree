# USE8.2 AI Infrastructure

This skill introduces users to AI services hosted on HPC systems via web and API interfaces.
Rather than deploying or managing models, users focus on accessing and using them through friendly platforms like web dashboards or through APIs.
The emphasis is on understanding how to send queries to models, interpret responses, and integrate them into tasks.
Part of this skill is becoming familiar with tokens, endpoints, and response handling â€” essential for using AI tools programmatically.

## Requirements

## Learning Outcomes

* Access AI tools via a web interface and understand basic interaction workflows.
* Send requests to AI models using API interfaces and interpret structured responses.
* Understand how to use API keys, endpoints, and basic request formatting (e.g., JSON).
* Distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous inference requests.
* Integrate simple AI responses into command-line or scripting workflows for automation.
