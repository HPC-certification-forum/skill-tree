# USE Overview: Use of the HPC Environment

HPC environments are different from local systems and cloud environments.

Practitioners typically face initial challenges to utilize such a system efficiently.
Moreover, often, data centers deploy a specific solution to set up and execute parallel applications.
That means users must be trained in a particular solution to utilize a supercomputer efficiently.

Various user roles are covered as part of this subtree: practitioners that aim to deploy existing parallel applications as well as testers that just run already deployed applications, and also developers that create new applications.
