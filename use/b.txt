# USE Use of the HPC Environment

HPC environments are different from local systems and cloud environments.

Practitioners typically face initial challenges to utilize such a system efficiently.
Moreover, often, data centers deploy a specific solution to set up and execute parallel applications.
That means users must be trained in a particular solution to utilize a supercomputer efficiently.

Various user roles are covered as part of this subtree: practitioners that aim to deploy existing parallel applications as well as testers that just run already deployed applications, and also developers that create new applications.

## Learning Outcomes

* Apply tools provided by the operating system to navigate and manage files and executables.
* Explain what programs and processes are and how the CLI interacts with and manages them.
* Use a workload manager to allocate HPC resources and run job using scripts.
* Select the software environment to build existing OpenSource projects 
* Develop novel parallel applications effectively.
* Design and deploy scripts that automatize repetitive tasks.
* Construct workflows that utilize remote (distributed) environments to execute a parallel workflow.
* Illustrate the use of post processing tools for analyzing and visualizing results.
